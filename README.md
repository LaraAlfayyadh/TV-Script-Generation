# Deep Learning Nanodegree - project3


## TV Script Generation with RNN
 - This project generates a TV script from scratch using RNNs. It is one of the projects from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
 - The model is trained on a part of the Seinfeld's dataset of TV scripts from 9 seasons (1989-1998).
 - The Neural Network generate a new,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
 - The RNN network uses word embeddings and LSTM layers.  
 - The length of the output script can be customized to the desired size.
